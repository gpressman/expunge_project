<h2>If you were arrested after 10/1/2007, then your record should be automatically expunged. You can get your criminal record (hover CJIS with info) to make sure your case was expunged. (hyperlink to "I don't know page") You should speak with an attorney if you have any further questions about your case.</h2><br>
