<h3>Why is expungement important?</h3>
	<p>
		Expungement gives you a clean slate. Having criminal charges on your record can prevent you from finding employment, 		public housing, and other government services. Expunging your criminal record can make accessing work, housing, and 		services easier.

<h3>What is expungeable?</h3>
<p>The answer to this question is a difficult one. There are many factors that determine if your record is expungeable. This difficulty is why we created ExpungeMaryland. By using this app you will be able to get to the bottom of whether or not your case is expungeable.</p>

<h3>How much does expungement cost?</h3>
<p>It costs $30 to expunge a single case. However, many people qualify for a fee waiver that makes expungement free. If you are eligible for expungement, your attorney can help you file for a fee waiver.</p>

<h3>How long does the process take?</h3>
<p>The statute says this process should take you 90 days. But in some jurisdictions, like Baltimore City, it can take up to 8 months.</p>

<h3>What if my criminal record is in a state besides Maryland?</h3>
<p>ExpungeMaryland.com can only help you expunge your criminal record in Maryland. You’ll need to contact an attorney or legal aid service in the state where your criminal record is for more information.</p>
