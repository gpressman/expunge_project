  <h1>About ExpungeMaryland.com</h1></div>

<div class="basicbody">
<p style="font-size: 20px;">This is a web app created for people with criminal records in Maryland.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">A criminal record is a barrier to employment, education, and other services. Luckily, some criminal records can be erased through the expungement process. However, while many criminal records can be erased, few people apply for expungement. This web app aims to clarify criminal expungement, with the hope of more people getting their records erased!</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">This app was created for Maryland by <a href="https://twitter.com/jtashea" target="_blank">Jason Tashea</a> and Jonathan Tippens for <a href="http://www.acy.org/" target="_blank">Advocates for Children and Youth</a>. The <a href="http://www.mikvachallenge.org/site/epage/146561_719.htm" target="_blank">idea for this app</a> came from the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/MCJJustice" target="_blank">Juvenile Justice Council</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikvaChallenge" target="_blank">Mikva Challenge</a> in Chicago, Illinois, and was originally developed by Cathy Deng. <br><br>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Advocates for Children and Youth improves the lives and experiences of Maryland’s children through policy change and program improvement. We are every child’s ally, working with government agencies and elected officials to continuously improve each child’s present and future.
Through our multi-issue platform, we affect the entirety of children’s worlds—the systems they touch, the people they interact with, and the environment where they live. We champion solutions to child welfare, education, health, and juvenile justice issues, positioning us to influence the full spectrum of youth experiences. We use independent research and proven best practices to recommend policies and pro­grams that create measurable results.</p>
