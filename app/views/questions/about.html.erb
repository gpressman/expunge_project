<p style="font-size: 20px;">This is a web app created for people with criminal records in Maryland.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">A criminal record is a barrier to employment, education, and other services. Luckily, some criminal records can be erased through the expungement process. However, while many criminal records can be erased, few people apply for expungement. This web app aims to clarify criminal expungement, with the hope of more people getting their records erased!</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">This app was created for Maryland by <a href="https://twitter.com/jtashea" target="_blank">Jason Tashea</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tppnsj" target="_blank">Jonathan Tippens</a> for <a href="http://www.acy.org/" target="_blank">Advocates for Children and Youth</a>. The <a href="http://www.mikvachallenge.org/site/epage/146561_719.htm" target="_blank">idea for this app</a> came from the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/MCJJustice" target="_blank">Juvenile Justice Council</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikvaChallenge" target="_blank">Mikva Challenge</a> in Chicago, Illinois, and was originally developed by Cathy Deng. <br><br>
