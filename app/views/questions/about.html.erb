<p class="">This is a web app created for people with criminal records in Maryland.</p>

<p>A criminal record is a barrier to employment, education, and other services. Luckily, some criminal records can be erased through the expungement process. However, while many criminal records can be erased, few people apply for expungement. This web app aims to clarify criminal expungement, with the hope of more people getting their records erased!</p>

<p>This app was created for Maryland by <a href="https://twitter.com/jtashea" target="_blank">Jason Tashea</a> and Jonathan Tippens for <a href="http://www.acy.org/" target="_blank">Advocates for Children and Youth</a>. The <a href="http://www.mikvachallenge.org/site/epage/146561_719.htm" target="_blank">idea for this app</a> came from the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/MCJJustice" target="_blank">Juvenile Justice Council</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikvaChallenge" target="_blank">Mikva Challenge</a> in Chicago, Illinois, and was originally developed by Cathy Deng. <br><br>

<p>Advocates for Children and Youth (ACY) was founded in 1987 by a group of prominent child advocates in Maryland who saw the need for an independent organization to advocate for the needs of the state's children and families in the community, the media and the public policy arena. ACY's mission is to identify problems, promote policies and programs that improve results for Maryland's children in measurable and meaningful ways, and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and policies for the state's children and youth.</p>
